I was inspired by "Shift Cipher" while doing this assignment.

The encryption system uses the length of the input as a key value. E.g., the input "Hello" has 5 letters so every letter gets shifted 5 letters forward when doing an encryption. The same goes for decryption but it does backwards shifting.

Don't forget to set your encoding to UTF-8, otherwise some special characters will have wrong values such as -1
